# Working with Hashes - Enumerables

Hashes are awesome. They provide us with the 
ability to store any amount of data values and make
each value instantly accessible using its corresponding
key. With nested data structures, we can contain all
sorts of related information in a single object.

Hashes, however, can quickly get complicated as they
grow in size. In this section are lessons and labs 
related to working with hashes, with topics including:

* Iterating over hashes
* Collecting values from hashes
* Finding a specific value in a hash
* Building hashes through iteration
* Performing calculations on and aggregating hash values
